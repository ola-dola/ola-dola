👨🏾‍🔬 I'm a **software engineer** based in Nigeria. 
 I'm currently looking for opportunities to build impactful and amazing software products with an amazing team(remote and limited onsite(Nigeria)).

💻 I currently code mainly in **Javascricpt(React, Node.js, Express, PostgresSql) and Python**, and still learning more.

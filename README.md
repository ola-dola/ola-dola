👨🏾‍🔬 I'm a **software engineer** based in Nigeria. 
 I'm currently looking for opportunities to build impactful and amazing software products with an amazing team(remote or anywhere in Nigeria).

💻 I currently code mainly in **Javascript(React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)** and dabble in Python(💙) scripting.

👨🏾‍🔬 I'm a **software engineer** based in Nigeria. 
 I'm currently looking for opportunities to build impactful and amazing software products with an amazing team(remote or limited onsite(Nigeria)).
 
🔭 I’m currently working on a [city bus booking app](https://github.com/PickMe-Bus) in collaboration with a friend.

🌱 I’ve been learning about Data Structures and Algorithms the past couple of weeks. A lot of fun and tears 😎

💻 I currently code mainly in **Javascricpt(React, Node.js, Express, PostgresSql) and Python**, and still learning more.

Take a look around to see my work, then shoot me a mail at oredolaolamide[@]gmail[dot]com 🙂
